# project_DBMS3
This project is about building a recommendation system based on the information of books in Kazakh language. This recommender system uses machine learning algorithms to provide users book recommendations. This is a Database Management Project about Library Management System with the recommendation system built with machine learning algorithms. We decided to do this because, it is the best way to improve our reading skills and also can help people who are in searching for the best book to read by their own criterias. The project's goal is to improve skills in connecting database server with programming languages. And also for ourselves we want to obtain practical experience in databases. Our project would have features like Login,Admin,Issue,Return, Recommender etc. We are planning to use python for connecting with SQLite database and PHP as backend. We are going to do web application, so that we we will use CSS and HTML as instruments for creating web frontend.
